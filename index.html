                <p>I build and run hospitality and experiential businesses across stages—from launch through sustained operation.</p>
                
                <p>My work centers on translating vision into operational reality: setting culture, building teams, designing systems, and holding complexity across brand, people, and execution. I've served as a CEO, an embedded general manager, interim COO and an independent founder, operating across private social clubs, wellness studios, experiential venues, and curated travel.</p>
                
                <p>I'm most valuable in environments where ambiguity is high, systems are incomplete, and brand must be made real through lived experience. I step into gaps instinctively, take responsibility for outcomes, and function at an executive level regardless of title.</p>
                
                <p>After a decade of running Lightbox, I've spent recent years embedded across hospitality and lifestyle projects in New York's Hudson Valley, stabilizing early-stage ventures and leading operational buildouts. I'm currently at an inflection point, reassessing where to direct my energy and what structural alignment looks like going forward.</p>

                        Lightbox is an experience incubator launching next-generation consumer experiences in purpose-built spaces. I joined as the first hire and later served as CEO, leading the company from its initial build-out through growth, scale, and long-term sustainability.
I oversaw all aspects of the business, including business development, operations, finance, and team leadership. During my tenure, I drove consistent year-over-year revenue growth (~30%), secured close to 100 events annually with clients ranging from emerging brands to Fortune 500 companies, and expanded Lightbox's scope across B2B events, community programming, and consumer-facing experiences.
I grew the team from zero to fifteen, built operational and financial systems, and worked closely with the board on strategic planning and decision-making. During COVID, I safeguarded the business by securing government funding, retaining employees, and pivoting toward new consumer experience formats in response to a collapsed events market.
Lightbox continues to operate today, and I remain involved as an advisor, supporting the team on strategy and key initiatives as needed.

                        Madam Brett Social Club is a private members' social club in Beacon, NY, designed as a cultural and community-driven space for creatives, builders, and entrepreneurs. There, I led the club from pre-launch through early operations.
The role focused on establishing the club's operational and cultural foundations, including recruiting and training the front-of-house team, defining service standards, and setting the day-to-day rhythm of the space. Member acquisition and onboarding were led end to end, building the referral pipeline and shaping the tone, expectations, and social dynamics of the founding community.
Throughout launch and early operations, I served as the primary point of contact between ownership, members, staff, and external collaborators, ensuring alignment across vision, execution, and growth.

All scheduling, booking, and customer service workflows were designed and implemented end to end through dedicated software platforms, ensuring a seamless experience for both clients and staff.
I helped build Alchemy's operational infrastructure, including staffing models, class and treatment scheduling, payroll coordination, policies, and on-site service standards. In parallel with the team, also shaping the in-space experience, working across layout, flow, lighting, amenities, and guest journey to ensure the studio felt intentional, warm, and well run at every touchpoint.

                    <p class="project-description">
                        Les Champs du Sud was born from a desire to create a bridge between New York and the French countryside where I grew up, and between modern creativity and deep-rooted rural culture. It's a project rooted in Aveyron's authenticity, its emerging generation of chefs, farmers, winemakers, artisans, and makers who are reclaiming tradition while shaping the region's future.
Rather than a conventional tour, I design experiences that feel like invitations into a place: slow mornings exploring landscape and craft, long meals with producers in fields and farms, conversations with winemakers in hidden cellars, and unplanned moments that become the most memorable. Each edition is a curated week that surfaces Aveyron's rhythms and reveals aspects of a region too often overlooked - from its picturesque fields to its still-secret spots and evolving cultural scene.
Les Champs du Sud treats travel as immersion: a space for connection, curiosity, and belonging. It is about feeling at home in a landscape that is at once ancient and vibrantly alive.

The role focused on strengthening internal workflows and cross-functional collaboration across a 15+ person team, identifying process bottlenecks, and improving communication between departments. Regular 1:1s were held with team members to provide feedback, support professional development, and help stabilize day-to-day operations in a high-pressure, live-event environment.
In parallel, I supported and led brand partnership efforts, establishing and nurturing relationships with partners including Soho House, Neuehouse, and Entrepreneur Magazine, contributing to ticket sales growth and expanded brand visibility.

                        Decode Experiential was a creative collaboration between Lightbox and As We Are, focused on exploring how digital art can exist meaningfully within experiential and public spaces.
Initially launched as a community-driven talk series at Lightbox, Decode combined immersive installations with live conversations featuring digital artists, filmmakers, and technologists. The series gathered hundreds of people from the creative community and was designed to move beyond superficial "experiential" formats, prioritizing genuine interaction with both the work and the artists behind it.
The project later scaled into large-format public art with META—morphosis, a month-long digital exhibition at One Times Square, showcasing animated works by 21 digital artists on the building's newly launched screens—temporarily transforming one of the world's most commercialized visual environments into an artist-led, ad-free experience.
